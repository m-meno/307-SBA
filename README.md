1) When planning for this project I could have taken the time to think through my containerization a bit more. I ended up needing to go back in and add more divs to achieve the layout I wanted and I could have saved time and effort if I had thought through containerization my wireframes more. 
2) Layout continues to be the biggest challenge for me. I had a hard time with my table and getting the header of the title to be centered. I also had a hard time adding my GIF because I was not diligent about having a closing tag for each of my sections in my HTML. The more I practice the more I start to learn what tools are the most useful in certain contexts, so I think with more planning and practice future projects will be easier.
